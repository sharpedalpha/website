                <h4>Tactical Asset Allocation</h4>

                The asset allocation of our fund will be based on a multi-asset strategy adopting a risk parity approach to define the weights of the various assets.
                <br><br>Our fund will have a predominantly equity exposure, limiting the exposure of bonds to less than 20%, and allocating part of the capital to anti-inflationary assets such as TIPS, gold, real estate and Bitcoin.
                <br><br>The portion of the bond carrier will be shared among the Treasury Inflation-Protected Notes, which will help us to have a "buffer" against any market collapses to take advantage of any new opportunity, and high yields in Asia, which at this time have seen a decline in prices and could represent a medium-term opportunity.
                <br><br>A small portion of the fund will be exposed to Bitcoin through the fund of Grayscale, the main purpose is to ride the final phase of the current bull market with speculative intent, but we remain confident that this asset will prove important in the coming years to cope with currency debasement.
                <br><br>Finally, a portion of our portfolio will be exposed to gold and real estate, through a vanguard ETF on REITs and an iShares ETF that physically replies the price of gold, we expect that, in an inflationary environment, tangible assets such as gold and real estate can perform well and maintain better value than bonds.
                <br><br>At the current listing below 1800 dollars, gold presents a good upside opportunity being about 10% below its all-time high.

                <h4>Portfolio Construction</h4>
                To have a selection of stocks in which being exposed to overperform the market we tried to build estimates of their value based on different criteria.
                <br><br>The main factors in determining the intrinsic value of the stocks for our strategic asset allocation, due to the short time horizon of the challenge, was the seasonality of the sectors, followed by high market capitalization, some key financial indicators (mainly P/E and adjusted revenues growth), a momentum trend in the short term (less than 1 year, but weighting more the most recent months), and finally studying analysts consensus to determine the relative valuation of each stock to their main competitors.
                <br><br>From the equity screening, we obtained some interesting stocks that operate in the commodity sectors that could benefit in 
                an inflationary environment, so we also looking at the seasonality in stock return and have identified different companies that could have positive returns in this end quarter characterized by increasing demand.
                <br><br>In our fund we have selected the following assets

              <article id='tabs-3'>
                <h4>Past Returns Analysis</h4>
                Over a backtesting period of 4 years, our portfolio gave an absolute return of 98% which is correspond to an 18% annualized return. The volatility associated with this portfolio is equal to 6.424% so we obtained a Sharpe ratio of 2.8.
                <br><br>On the other hand, The S&P 500 (our benchmark) in the same time horizon returned a 75% or a 15% annualized, with a volatility of 10.936% and a Sharpe ratio of 1.37.
                <br><br>In the last year, our portfolio obtain really satisfactory returns compared to the benchmark, with less severe draw-dawns and more accentuate performance spikes, but this is probably due to the bias in the stock picking over this year.
