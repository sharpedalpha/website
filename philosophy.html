              <h2>Philosophy based on  <em>current  market conditions</em></h2> <br>
              <span>After 20 months from the Covid outbreak, we could see the end of the pandemic near with good effectiveness of vaccines in containing the impact on health systems, however, these months of intermittent closures and "barriers" created between the several economic areas have carried to a damage of the supply chain. <br><br><br> 
                All this combined with an expansive monetary policy as never before seen in history led to a review of moderate inflation during 2021, almost all raw materials have seen an important rise in their prices accentuating the inflationary flare-up and generating some slowdowns in production processes.
                <br> <br> <br>On the monetary policy side, the FED is assessing the implementation of the tapering by reducing the current ultra-expansive policy so as not to get out of hand inflation, however we are convinced that the tapering will be very moderate and could still be stopped immediately if there were signs of weakness in the US economy. <br><br><br> 
              At a global level, the main central banks will follow the FEDâ€™s policies with some lagging period, it is correct to assume that at this historical stage, moderate but not excessive inflation, coupled with low rates, represents the least evil for governments that could thus alleviate the heavy burden of public and private debt while preserving the state of the economy.
              <br>We therefore expect the inflationary phase to continue in the coming six-month periods and that tapering attempts to contain it will in fact be limited and aimed at maintaining the viability of central banks.
              <br> <br><br>
              After the Pandemic, the next major driver of monetary and fiscal policy will focus on economic transition and sustainable development, for this to be achieved, huge quantities of raw materials are needed and this leads us to be optimistic about the commodity sector in the coming years.
